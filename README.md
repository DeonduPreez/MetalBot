#MetalBot 
This is a Discord bot I am writing to moderate all of my own servers.

I do not expect it to do anything special, I just want the experience of writing a bot and the freedom to make it do whatever I want it to.

**Do not download and use this bot if you are easily offended as I will most likely be adding my own humour into the bot**

Feel free to use the bot and let me know if you find bugs, or better yet, make a PR and we can add it into the bot.

I am a professional Software Developer, but since this bot is written for fun I'm not necessarily using best practice everywhere, although the bot is written to be used on any server.

This bot uses [MySql](https://www.mysql.com) and [Discord.Net](https://www.google.com)

I am personally running [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to manage MySql, but feel fre to use whatever you want as long as [MySql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MySql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore) supports it
